The aim of this study is to estimate country-specific seroprevalence profiles based on age-stratified seroprevalence data, and to derive incidence rates using force-of-infection (FOI) calculations, along with estiamtes of the number of infections at different symptomatic stages, and DALY estimates. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate country-specific burden of chikungunya, incorporating information on the proportion of individuals with symptomatic, hospitalised, and chronic infections based on the review findings
